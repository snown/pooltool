echo "   • Select: 1 (upgrade)"
echo "   • Select: visual"
echo "   • Select: 5 (NEW-14T unallocated drive)"
echo "   • Verify automatic device path resolution"

echo "3️⃣ **Test Background Transfer Mode:**"
echo "   • During rsync step, select 'B' (background)"
echo "   • Verify SSH-safe transfer with nohup"
echo "   • Test transfer monitoring and resumption"

echo "📝 **Expected Results:**"
echo "• All 7 workflow steps execute without errors"
echo "• Enhanced rsync offers foreground/background choice"
echo "• Unallocated drives resolve to device paths automatically"
echo "• Background transfers survive SSH disconnection"
echo "• Workflow state management enables resumption"
echo "• Final drive integration and cleanup successful"

echo "🔧 **Next Steps:**"
echo "1. Execute manual testing scenarios above"
echo "2. Document any issues or edge cases found"
echo "3. Update testing plan with results"
echo "4. Mark Priority 3 as complete if all tests pass"
