# pooltool - Interactive Drive Management System

**üîß Built on [Bash with Nails](https://github.com/mindaugasbarysas/bashwithnails)** - A bash framework providing module loading, namespacing, and dependency management.

## ü§ñ **FOR AI AGENTS: REQUIRED READING**

**‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: Before making ANY changes to this codebase, you MUST read these files:**

1. **[DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md](./DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md)** - Module patterns, namespace conventions, performance best practices
2. **[INTERACTIVE_DRIVE_MANAGEMENT_PLAN.md](./INTERACTIVE_DRIVE_MANAGEMENT_PLAN.md)** - Architecture overview and implementation status  
3. **[bootstrap.sh](./bootstrap.sh)** - Understand the module loading system (Bash with Nails framework)
4. **[Bash with Nails Documentation](https://github.com/mindaugasbarysas/bashwithnails/blob/master/docs/man.md)** - Framework patterns and features

**Key Rules for AI Agents:**
- ‚úÖ Always follow the [Bash with Nails](https://github.com/mindaugasbarysas/bashwithnails) framework patterns
- ‚úÖ Prefix helper functions with module name (e.g., `modulename::helper`) to avoid namespace collisions
- ‚úÖ Use bulk health collection functions (not per-drive calls)
- ‚úÖ Test changes with existing test commands in pooltool.sh
- ‚ùå Never use generic function names like `print_help` without module prefix
- ‚ùå Never make individual arcconf calls for multiple drives

## Overview
`pooltool` is a modular Bash-based utility built on the **[Bash with Nails](https://github.com/mindaugasbarysas/bashwithnails)** framework for managing files and disks in a RAID storage environment. It provides commands for finding, copying, moving files, and managing disks and SnapRAID devices, with advanced interactive drive management and health monitoring capabilities.

## Usage

### Running pooltool
To use `pooltool`, run the main script:
```bash
./pooltool.sh <command> [options]
```

### Available Commands
- `find` ‚Äî Locate files or paths within the RAID pool.
- `cp` ‚Äî Copy files or directories into the RAID pool, ensuring the target is within the RAID.
- `mv` ‚Äî Move files or directories into the RAID pool (uses `cp` then removes the source).
- `disk` ‚Äî Manage disks, including adding new disks and labeling partitions.
- `devices` ‚Äî Query SnapRAID devices for names, volumes, partitions, and mountpoints.
- `health` ‚Äî Monitor drive health status with automation support and upgrade evaluation.
- `workflow` ‚Äî Manage complex drive replacement workflows with progress tracking.

Use `-h` or `--help` with any command for usage information:
```bash
./pooltool.sh <command> -h
```

### Drive Health and Evaluation
Monitor drive health and get upgrade recommendations:
```bash
# Check all drives
./pooltool.sh health

# Evaluate drives and recommend upgrade candidates
./pooltool.sh health --evaluate

# Get JSON output for automation
./pooltool.sh health --evaluate --json
```

The evaluation feature analyzes:
- **Drive age** (power-on hours)
- **Health status** (SMART data)
- **Temperature** monitoring
- **Capacity** and space utilization
- **Risk assessment** with upgrade priorities

## Functionality
- **Framework**: Built on [Bash with Nails](https://github.com/mindaugasbarysas/bashwithnails) providing module loading and namespacing
- Modular design: Commands are loaded dynamically via `bootstrap.sh`.
- Namespace support: Each command is namespaced for clarity and isolation.
- Dependency management: Modules declare dependencies and are loaded as needed.
- RAID safety: Copy and move operations require the target to be within the RAID location.
- Disk management: The `disk` command assists with adding and labeling disks, checking block devices, and integrating with SnapRAID.
- SnapRAID integration: The `devices` command provides detailed information about SnapRAID devices.

## Directory Structure
- `pooltool.sh` ‚Äî Main entry point.
- `bootstrap.sh` ‚Äî Module loader and environment setup.
- `modules/pooltool/commands/` ‚Äî Command implementations (`find`, `cp`, `mv`, `disk`).
- `modules/snapraid/devices` ‚Äî SnapRAID device management.
